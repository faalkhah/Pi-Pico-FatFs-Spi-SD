# Pi-Pico-FatFs-Spi-SD

## Raspberry Pi Pico SD Card Example (C SDK)

This project is a simple example of interfacing an **SD card with Raspberry Pi Pico** using the **C SDK**.  
It demonstrates how to initialize the SD card over SPI and perform basic file operations with the FatFS library.

The project was adapted and inspired by the following resources:

- [FatFs - Generic FAT Filesystem Module](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html)
- [Random Nerd Tutorials ‚Äì Raspberry Pi Pico: MicroSD Card with MicroPython](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/raspberry-pi-pico-microsd-card-micropython/)  
- [carlk3/no-OS-FatFS-SD-SPI-RPi-Pico](https://github.com/carlk3/no-OS-FatFS-SD-SPI-RPi-Pico)

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `src/` ‚Äî C source files for SD card initialization and FatFS usage  
- `include/` ‚Äî header files  
- `CMakeLists.txt` ‚Äî build configuration for CMake
- ‚Äç`FatFs_SPI` - FatFs file system

## üöÄ Build and Flash
1. Set up the **Raspberry Pi Pico SDK** environment.  
   - Follow the official guide: [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)  
2. Clone this repository and initialize the project with CMake:  
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
3. Flash the generated `.uf2` file to your Pico board.

## Prerequisites:
* Raspberry Pi Pico
* A SD/Micro SD SPICard Board
* Breadoard and wires
* Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK
* (Optional) A Couple of ~10KŒ© resistors for pull-ups
* (Optional) A capacitor for decoupling ~10uF
* Set your SPI-MISO-MOSI-SCK

## Features:
* Support SD Cards V1 and V2
* Support long files name
* Support Persian and Arabic characters
* Support Unicode
* Supports Real Time Clock for maintaining file and directory time stamps
* Problem with 32GB Micro SD cards yet.

## Capabilities:
* Detect SD Cards and mount it as drive 0:
* Directory of SD Card
* Create and write a sample file with name hello_world.txt
* Read the content of file

## Debugging
* Monitor with a terminal applications such as puTTY in Windows
* Monitor with Screen command in Mac and linux such as
```bash
   screen /dev/tty.usbmodem14501 115200
```
* Failed to mount, the pi-pico led blinking fast
* After mount, the pi-pico led on 1 sec for writting file
